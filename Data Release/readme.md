This folder contains source data, processing codes (in the form of Jupyter Notebooks), and a cache of processed data for a data release of information associated with US Fish and Wildlife [National Listing Workplan](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/what-we-do/listing-workplan.html) species. This work is part of an overall response by USGS science centers and programs to characterize the current state of knowledge and expertise on these species that can be used to aid USFWS listing evaluation processes. The intent of this data release is to provide a tool for continuously updating a knowledge bank of available information that can be consulted at any time during the development and writing of Species Status Assessments or other aspects of the listing process.

# Species and Capability Source Information
As a starting point for this work, we used a spreadsheet prepared internally to USGS that included a listing of the species taken from the original USFWS PDF file released online along with value-added information from a survey of USGS Science Centers and Cooperative Research Units seeking input on what previous and current research activities and capabilities might apply. A snapshot of this spreadsheet is included in the sources folder and is referenced in a number of the processing codes. An additional spreadsheet was prepared with a set of links for species to the USFWS Ecological Conservation Online System (ECOS) extracted from those embedded as Excel hyperlinks in one of the worksheets along with a set of explicit links to additional information sources for USGS Science Centers from the ScienceBase Directory.

# Processing Logic
The building of this dataset is based in a set of logical processes we are building for a variety of work on a platform called the Biogeographic Information System. The codes that consult other data sources and assemble information for use in this data release come from a Python package called [bispy](https://github.com/usgs-bcb/bispy). The particular workflows described and executed here can be operated in a variety of ways from producing something like the local cache of data we include in this data release to running operationally on a cloud system, checking sources and building data continuously.

# Workflow
Some of the steps in this system build upon each other while others can be operated independently. The primary initial step for most processes involves reading out the list of species, assembling species names and available identifiers for use in other steps.
