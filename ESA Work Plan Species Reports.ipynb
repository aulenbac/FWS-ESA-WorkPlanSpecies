    "The \"ESA WP Species TIR Processing\" notebook ran through the basic processing of the set of work plan species using Taxa Information Registry functions to populate a bunch of data for further exploration and analysis. These data were placed into a MongoDB collection as part of an experimental platform we work with on the ESIP Testbed. The data are accessible right now through a low level API with authentication through Python, R, or other code. Once we determine what aspects of these data are interesting for further use, we will build out a higher level API and features for more simplified access for other users, including making data public or providing simple authentication methods.\n",

    "# Names and Taxonomy\n",
    "We started with just the original names from a supplied spreadsheet that we believe started with the common names in the [National Listing Work Plan](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/Listing%207-Year%20Workplan%20Sept%202016.pdf) but added in scientific names. Most of these records also had links to the USFWS Ecological Conservation Online System (ECOS) where we were able to further reduce ambiguity in the species being identified. We were able to pick up ITIS Taxonomic Serial Numbers from the referenced ECOS pages, and from these we tapped into species data from the USFWS Threatened and Endangered Species System and consulted ITIS itself. Through all of these steps we continued to build more and more data into the system that can then be evaluated for various uses."

    "This next codeblock uses the generated array of unique scientific names to output a summary of names and their sources for further examination. A few of these are anomalies based on slight string mismatches that are no big deal and could have been dealt with previously. Notable things for future examination include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The majority of these are cases where there appears to be a disagreement in ITIS for the supplied scientific name. These mostly show up here where you'll see more than one ITIS name, followed by an \"invalid\" or \"unaccepted\" flag and a TSN that matches the TSN picked up from ECOS. The FWS system has a TSN that ITIS considers to be invalid for some reason. There may be good case for argument on these, but they could be noted for FWS biologists to consider if they haven't already done so. Some of the more notable cases are where two different identified species names are the same taxonomy according to ITIS. This may already be well known to the relevant FWS biologists and is likely a part of the petition review process.\n",
    "* There are a few cases where only a genus name was supplied, and we didn't perhaps deal with these quite as elegantly as we could have in this synthesis exercise.\n",

The intent will be to remain true to what the original data supplied."
